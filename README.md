Welcome to **URL Bully**, a straightforward tool designed to test the resilience of web servers at the URL level. While it can be described as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or a brute-forcing strategy, its primary purpose is to explore the limits of web server security. This tool aims to identify weaknesses that could lead to a breakdown in service or application functionality.
